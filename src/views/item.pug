         p https://www.googleapis.com/auth/books
         p To request access using OAuth 2.0, your application needs the scope information, 
         p as well as information that Google supplies when you register your application 
         p (such as the client ID and the client secret).
         p Tip: The Google APIs client libraries can handle some of the authorization process
         p for you. They are available for a variety of programming languages; check the page 
         p with libraries and samples for more details.
